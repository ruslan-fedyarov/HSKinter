         HSKinter - Chinese Words Study (HSK 1-4) on Desktop and Phone


INSTALLATION

Unpack .tar.gz file to a folder.

Make sure your system has Python 2, Python 3 or Pydroid 3 installed.

On Android it makes sense to change the line 'pydroid=False' of 'hskinter.py'
to 'pydroid=True' to hear the pronunciation.

For sound you will also need gTTS installed (use Pydroid's terminal or shell):

    pip install gTTS

On desktop you should additionally install playsound (Android uses Kivy libs):

    pip install playsound

You can also use the same packages from your operating system distribution.

Your system may need additional Chinese fonts installed to show the characters
properly.


LAUNCHING

On most systems with Python and Tkinter installed, the application should run
out of the box in mute mode. Just launch (click) the file 'hskinter.py'.

Alternatively, you can open 'hskinter.py' in IDLE (typically comes with Python)
and press F5 to run it.

Or you can open your shell, change to the unpacking directory and enter:

    python hskinter.py

On the phone, open 'hskinter.py' in Pydroid and press the yellow 'Run' button.


USAGE NOTES

The same user should run the program in the same writable directory with files
'hsk.json' and 'hsk' (the latter is automatically created user's statistics).

Click or tap the elements of the window to get explanation or action info.

The program typically starts in flashcard mode, press 'OK' to go to the next
word. Use this mode when you're not familiar with most of the words in an
HSK level.

In flashcard mode the program prefers words with statistically fewer correct
answers (lower 'lvl'), and if the levels of the words are the same, it picks
words with longer time since the last answer (older ones), using the same
algorithm as in the answering mode. The last 10 words shown are checked to
avoid too much repetition in a row. Typing 'b4ck' shows the previous
flashcard (just one).

To test your knowledge, click '[ ]' or type 'fl4sh' (with digit '4' instead
of 'a') to enter the answering mode. Now you can type a translation of the
hanzi shown. If there are multiple translations, you can enter either of them.
The correctness is indicated immediately. Press 'OK' to save the answer to
the internal stats and move to the next word. If there was a shorter answer
for that hanzi, the program may hint you at that.

You may sometimes prefer entering the hanzi itself, not a translation, then
the program will simply compare it to the original. This way you can practice
your Pinyin input skills.

You can enter 'hsk1', 'hsk2' etc to turn HSK levels on or off. Any combination
is allowed for both flashcard and answering mode. To switch several levels to
the opposite mode, enter 'hsk1-3', 'hsk2-4' or similar.

It is possible to use only the first NN% of an HSK level. To do this, type
'hskN.N' or 'hskN.NN' and press enter. For example, to select the first 10%
of HSK 2 (15 words, to be exact), enter 'hsk2.1' or 'hsk2.10'. If you need
only 1% of HSK 4 (6 words), enter 'hsk4.01' etc. This is especially useful
at higher HSK levels where the number of new words can easily become
overwhelming. To set the percentage for several HSK levels simultaneously,
enter 'hskN-N.N' or 'hskN-N.NN', e.g. 'hsk1-4.01' (1% of each HSK).

By default, 100% of all levels are used when you turn them on or off. To get
this 100% state of a level back, use 'hskN.0'. When you type 'hsk', the
current percentage of active levels is shown as a reminder. The same per
cents are applied to both flashcard and answering mode.

The recommended approach is to add 15 to 25 new words at a time (2%-10%
depending on HSK level, e.g. 'hsk1.10', 'hsk2.05', 'hsk4.02'), then to cycle
through their flashcards for a couple of days, and finally to bring the
levels of all these new words to 9 in the answering mode, maintaining the
old words too. When confident enough, start again this learning cycle by
adding another dozen or two ('hsk1.20' etc).

To get the retaining statistics, you should click the word 'Lvl' or you can
type 'st4ts' (with digit '4' instead of 'a'). The stats shows you the current
number of words for each retaining level (0 is the worst remembered--never
answered correctly for the last 9 questions, 9 is the best--9 correct answers
out of recent 9). Only currently used HSK levels and their per cents are
counted in the stats.

Exit the program by clicking 'Exit', by pressing Esc key or by closing the
window (on desktop), not by tapping 'Back' on Pydroid 3. Otherwise, it won't
save the changes of this session to 'hsk' file.

It's better to avoid rotating the phone when the program runs, or Pydroid
may abort the session.

To turn sound on, click 'X )' or type 's0und'. To use sound by default,
change 'soundon=False' to 'soundon=True' in 'hskinter.py'. You can turn off
flashcards similarly ('cards=True' to 'cards=False'). The font of the words
is adjustable too ('lab.config(font=("Helvetica", 30))')

You need to be online to fetch Google's pronunciation of a word shown for the
first time with sound on. This pronunciation is immediately stored to a newly
created 'gtts' folder as a tiny MP3 file. Next time the word is pronounced
using the saved file (cached).

If all the pronunciations of your current HSK levels have already been fetched
(you have 150, 300, 600 or 1200 MP3 files in 'gtts' directory), you can use
the program offline with sound on. You can also copy the whole 'gtts'
directory to another system/device and use it with another copy of the
program, it should work fine.

The file 'hsk.json' is human readable and editable (UTF-8), its format is
pretty intuitive. Make a backup copy before altering it.

It also makes sense to regularly backup your personal stats file 'hsk'. Newer
versions of the program are backward compatible with the format of the file,
so you can just copy your stats to a newer version's directory, or overwrite
'hsk.json' and 'hskinter.py' of your older version with newer ones.
